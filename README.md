This is some work I've put in place to have a simple Gulp workflow that takes ES2015 React components of your choice and outputs them as HTML files.

The Gulp plugin that I have written is currently set to work with [gulp-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-data). I'll also add support out-of-the-box for [gulp-front-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-front-matter).

And I want this repository to have a lot of guidelines/examples for different scenarios. The plugin alone will only give you static site generation, but I want to provide an example on how you can make it isomorphic as well.
